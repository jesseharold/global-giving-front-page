# global-giving-front-page
Global Giving - working front page based on POC image.

To get a better sense of your strengths and interests, we have a small programming assignment for you. The intent is for this to take between 4 to 8 hours. Please timebox yourself and stop if you reach 8 hours.
Task

We’ve gotten feedback that our homepage could use some additional clarity about “how it works” and what we do. The current design isn’t optimal, so we’ve brainstormed a new design (Homepage-Mockup.png) that we’d like you to turn into a working webpage.

Please convert this PNG mockup into a working webpage. In the normal workflow, you would have been included in the brainstorm session, so you would have heard more of the user feedback and contribute ideas. Since we skipped that part, if you see ways to improve or enhance the UX/UI, you may do so.

## Requirements
● May use any mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you’d like.
● You may use any code that’s available on our site.
● We are not looking for pixel perfection from the mockup. We are looking to see a
working page that suits users’ needs.
● There are many valid ways to be successful at this.
● To simplify things, we encourage you to keep the header, top navigation, project
tiles/selector, and footer the same for this assignment. If something in there doesn’t work/look the same as production, that’s ok. We’re not concerned about these template elements for this assignment.

## Deliverables
● Please provide a link to a GitHub repo with your solution, email a zip file, or a link to a website showing your submission.
● Please provide a written overview of your solution. This can be an email, Google Doc, README file in GitHub, etc. Since you are limiting yourself to 4-8 hours, feel free to denote what would be included in the “next version” if you had more time.
